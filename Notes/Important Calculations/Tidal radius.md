The radius in which the Tidal forces are comparable to the self gravity of a star.
Say we have a star of mass $M_{\star}$ and radius $R_{\star}$  and it orbits a black hole of mass $\tilde{M}$  at a separation $\tilde{R}$  and we assume $\tilde{R}>R_{\star}$  is a circular orbit.
Imagine a particle of mass 1 $,$ sitting on the edge if the stars surface, it has three opposing forces acting on it the gravity of the star, the gravity of the black hole and the centrifugal force on the star:
$g_{\star}=\frac{GM_{\star}}{R_{\star}^2}$, $\tilde{g}=-\frac{G\tilde{M}}{(\tilde{R}-R_{\star})^2}$ $F_{cen}=\tilde{R} \omega^2=\frac{G\tilde{M}}{\tilde{R}^2}$  
So the tidal radius will be $\tilde{R}$  if $\Sigma \vec{F}_{particle}=0$ :
$$\frac{GM_{\star}}{R_{\star}^2}-\frac{G\tilde{M}}{(\tilde{R}-R_{\star})^2}+\frac{G\tilde{M}}{\tilde{R}^2}=0$$
We can simplify:
$$\frac{M_{\star}}{R_{\star}^2}\approx\frac{\tilde{M}}{(\tilde{R})^2}(1+2\frac{R_{\star}}{\tilde{R}})-\frac{\tilde{M}}{\tilde{R}^2}$$ 
$$\frac{M_{\star}}{R_{\star}^2}\approx2\frac{\tilde{M}R_{\star}}{\tilde{R}^3}$$

$$R_{t}\propto (\frac{\tilde{M}}{M_{\star}})^{\frac{1}{3}}R_{\star}$$
The same approximation can be done by just expanding the gravitational force on the star near its edge and subtracting the force on the center of mass.
This could be obtained also in exact form using the Roch lobe approach for rigid or fluid satellites, but the depandance on the mass ratio is
