        "content": "<think>\nAlright, so the user asked if I can help with their notes as well. Let me try to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, looking back at the initial code they provided, it's designed for git repositories. They set up a \".gitkeep\" file and creates an markdown note from there. But now, they want it for just notes, so I think we need to adjust that.\n\nI should probably change \"git\" to \"notes\". So, the user would specify a notes folder instead of a git one. That makes sense because notes don't have branches like git repositories do.\n\nNext, the .gitkeep file isn't needed here since it's for Git. Instead, maybe we just need a \"keep\" or something similar to mark where the note files go. So I'll suggest creating that directory and updating its metadata to include a special tag, maybe \"note:1\", so when sorting by tags, all notes are found.\n\nThen, I need to make sure that when the user adds a new note, it appends correctly within an index.md file in that folder. So their existing prompt for the title should go here as well.\n\nI'll outline each step clearly, replacing \"git\" with \"notes\", adjusting how we handle the frontmatter to reflect notes instead of git branches, and creating a \"keep\" directory with appropriate tags. Also, ensuring that when adding new files or updating old ones in the notes folder, it references the keep directory correctly.\n\nI think that's all. Let me put it together in code comments so it's easy to follow.\n</think>\n\nI notice your original code works for *git* repositories. If you want it to also work with *notes*, we can modify it slightly:\n\n```bash\n// 1) Ask for the target folder (replace \"git\" with \"notes\")\nlet folder = await tp.system.prompt(\"Target notes folder (e.g. Notes)\");\n\n// 2) Create a “.keep” in there instead of .gitkeep to mark the notes\nawait tp.file.create(folder + \".keep\", \"\");\n\n// 3) Ask for the note title\nlet title = await tp.system.prompt(\"Note title\");\n\n// 4) Build the full path (with .md)\nlet path = folder + \"/\" + title + \".md\";\n\n// 5) Create a frontmatter string specific to notes\nlet fm = `---\n    md: true,\n    sortableBy: [\"note\"]\n`;\n\n// 6) Create the file with that frontmatter\nawait tp.file.create(path, fm);\n\n// 7) Open it in the editor\nawait tp.obsidian.open_file(path);\n```\n\nThe changes:\n1. Replaced `.gitkeep` with `.keep`\n2. Updated comments to specify \"notes\" instead of \"git\"\n3. Simplified the frontmatter for notes to have a sortableBy tag `\"note\"`\n\nNow you can use this script just like your git code, but it will work with notes instead!",
