## 1. Introduction
A short survey on black holes. They have two defining characteristics: Mass and spin. They are unlimited to be at any mass theoretically but astrophysical are found in two mass classes: stellar mass and supermassive. stellar mass are usually observed due to X-ray radiation due to accretion. gravitational waves are measured from SMBH mergers and in the future could be measured from a SMBH and SMBH merger (LISA).
I galaxies of the size or larger then the milky way, it is thought that SMBH serve as a galactic nuclei, if the accretion rate is larger then 1% of the Eddington accretion limit they are considered active.
Fir SMBH the Eddington accretion limit is $\dot{M}_{Edd}=2.2\times 10^{-2}M_{\odot}yr^{-1}(\frac{0.1}{\eta})(\frac{M}{10^6M_{odot}})$ 
where $\eta$ is the efficiency of energy emotion of the accretion process.
those active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are among the brightest astrophysical sources.
If they accrete in lower rate we say they are quiescent, they are much harder to observe therefore, tidal disruption events can be a good tool to research them by.
A TDE is the event of a star of mass $M_{\star}$ and radius $R_{\star}$  passing in a highly eccentric orbit around a black hole and being torn apart by the tidal forces of the black hole. It is here a good point to define the [[Tidal radius]]: 
$$R_{t}\approx  (\frac{\tilde{M}}{M_{\star}})^{\frac{1}{3}}R_{\star}$$
At this radius the tidal forces from the blackhole overwhelm the self gravity of the star.
Since the star is ripped apart, some of the debris remain bound to the SMBH and some are ejected to space, the bound matter can produce luminous flare and ciruclize into an accretion disc.
Since the space around a SMBH has some type of length scale, due to general relativistic effects ($r_s=\frac{GM}{c^2}$), it is possible that for certain values of $R_t$ general relativistic dynamical effect such as orbital precession and so on are important to understand the hydrodynamics of the torn star and the radiation curves.
taking a limit of $R_t=5r_s$ it is possible to show that :
$$M_{Gr}\approx 10^7 M_{\odot}(\frac{R_{\star}}{R_{\odot}})^{3/2}(\frac{M_{\star}}{M_{\odot}})^{-1/2}$$
This means that for a sun-like star, the tidal radius could be effected greatly by GR, if it is disrupted by a SMBH with mass that is well within the SMBH mass range.
5 Schwarzschild radii is an arbitrary limit, but it could also be replaced with $r_s$  to give , the approximate mass of the SMBH in which a TDE of a sun-like star will occur on the event horizon of the black hole , therefor will not be seen , this is also called the Hill mass :

$$M_{H}\approx 10^8 M_{\odot}(\frac{R_{\star}}{R_{\odot}})^{3/2}(\frac{M_{\star}}{M_{\odot}})^{-1/2}$$
The TDEs could prove to be an excellent probe into the theory of black hole and GR but there are much of the hydrodynamics and radiation processes in such events that are misunderstood, and prevent the use of these events as a good probe.
## 2. Tidal disruption events in Newtonian gravity
*In general I think the better approach is like in chapter 1 to go and summarize thoroughly, however I don't believe I have enough time , so the next part is more scattered unfortunately*
- Several interesting definitions:
      - Radius of influence: $r_h=\frac{GM}{\sigma^2}$  - $\sigma$ is the velocity dispersion in the host galaxy. basically determines the radius in which the gravity from the SMBH dictates the motion of the matter in the galaxy. Usually $r_t\ll r_h$ .
      - Penetration factor $\beta = \frac{r_t}{r_p}$ - a factor that helps to determine the strength of the disruption effect,  $r_p$ in Newtonian physics is basically limited by $R_{\star}$ and by the event horizon of the black hole (meaning collation), but in general relativity this limitation will be even further since for $r_p<3r_s$, there are no bound orbits so any star will plunge into the black hole with that angular momentum. 
      - For a full disruption this penetration factor must be larger then some limit.
      - After penetrating the tidal sphere the debris move on nearly geodesic orbits around the SMBH, the have some spread of energy, some are bound and some are unbound, if we assume that the self gravity turns of instantaneously when this breach happens we ca approximate:
      $$\Delta \epsilon \ \approx \frac{GM_{\star}}{R_{\star}}(\frac{M}{M_{\star}})^{1/3} $$
