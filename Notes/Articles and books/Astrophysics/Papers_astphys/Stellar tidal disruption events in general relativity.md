## 1. Introduction
A short survey on black holes. They have two defining characteristics: Mass and spin. They are unlimited to be at any mass theoretically but astrophysical are found in two mass classes: stellar mass and supermassive. stellar mass are usually observed due to X-ray radiation due to accretion. gravitational waves are measured from SMBH mergers and in the future could be measured from a SMBH and SMBH merger (LISA).
I galaxies of the size or larger then the milky way, it is thought that SMBH serve as a galactic nuclei, if the accretion rate is larger then 1% of the Eddington accretion limit they are considered active.
Fir SMBH the Eddington accretion limit is $\dot{M}_{Edd}=2.2\times 10^{-2}M_{\odot}yr^{-1}(\frac{0.1}{\eta})(\frac{M}{10^6M_{odot}})$ 
where $\eta$ is the efficiency of energy emotion of the accretion process.
those active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are among the brightest astrophysical sources.
