## 1. Abstract in Brief
> They suggest a family of thick accretion disk solutions, to try and model the accretion disks i the inner region where they are known to be unstable and become thick. They use the PW potential for this.

## 2. Key Contributions
- At very large accretion rate the thin disk approximation breaks.

## 3. Methods & Approach
- 

## 4. Results & Conclusions
- 

## 5. Strengths & Weaknesses
- **Strengths:**  
  -  
- **Weaknesses / Open Questions:**  
  -  

## 6. Relation to My Work
