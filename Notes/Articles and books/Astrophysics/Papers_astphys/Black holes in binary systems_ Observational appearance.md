## 1. The General Picture
So this section start by stating that observationally there is a large number of black hole - stars binary systems in the galaxy.
These systems experience the mass transfer from the doner star to the BH companion.
They present the size $\alpha$ the efficiency of the underline mechanism that transport angular momentum out of the accretion disk.
$$\alpha=\frac{v_t}{v_s}+\frac{H^2}{4\pi\rho v_s^2}$$
$v_s$ is the speed of sound in this medium.
$v_t$ is the velocity of the turbulence in this medium.
