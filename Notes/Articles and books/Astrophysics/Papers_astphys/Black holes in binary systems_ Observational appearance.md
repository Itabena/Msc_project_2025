## 1. The General Picture
So this section start by stating that observationally there is a large number of black hole - stars binary systems in the galaxy.
These systems experience the mass transfer from the doner star to the BH companion.
They present the size $\alpha$ the efficiency of the underline mechanism that transport angular momentum out of the accretion disk.
$$\alpha=\frac{v_t}{v_s}+\frac{H^2}{4\pi\rho v_s^2}$$
$v_s$ is the speed of sound in this medium.
$v_t$ is the velocity of the turbulence in this medium.
$H$ is the magnetic field strength.
$\rho$ is the mass density of the matter.
Basically this can be connected to the simple model of accretion disk where there is a "friction" between circular layers of the accretion disk that leads "losing" angular momentum and falling to the center.
This spiraling fall motion leads to  release of gravitational energy, some of it is turns to radiation due to thermal heating of the matter. The energy  release is dependent on the accretion rate $\dot{M}$ . As shown also in [[Chapter_1|this book]] the critical accretion rate can be derived from the Eddington luminosity $L=\eta \dot{M} c^2$ where $\eta$ is the efficiency of energy release, in Schwarzschild  black holes it is approximately 6% and in Kerr black holes , it could go up to 40% for the critical spin value.
This efficiency is related to general relativistic effects , and the critical accretion rate , shows the top barrier of the phenomena.
Then they go on for what is the order of magnitude of luminosity and surface temperatures for sub-critical accretion rates.
then they go on to describe what observationally do they expect to see, and also about Neutron stars, this is not vey relevant to my needs right now.

## 2. The Theory of accretion discs in the subcritical regime.
They present the idea of an accretion disc around a black hole, setting the ISCO as the inner boundary and the ISCO energy $E-1=0.057mc^2$ as the accretion energy of a mass unit accreted, basically setting the efficiency.
 Basically the main angular momentum transport that are relevant to this problem are Turbulence and magnetic fields. If the magnetic fields are strong enough then can create a sufficient angular momentum transport for accretion.
 For a thin accretion disc, using some hand wavy explanation they suggest that the viscosity is $\nu=\alpha H c_s$ .
