# Chapter 1: Accretion as a source of energy.

## Flowing summery
Accretion of mass is thought to be one of the main power sources for different astrophysical phenomena.
Some order of magnitude calculations can show the production of energy in accretion:
The energy released by a body with mass $M$ and radius $R_*$ accretion $m$ mass is $\Delta E =\frac{GMm}{R_*}$ . For a neutron star with $M_\odot$  the radius of it is approximately $10km$ so the energy released per accreted mass can be $10^{20} \frac{erg}{g}$ , mainly as electromagnetic radiation. From fusion reaction  lets say H to He $10^{19} \frac{erg}{g}$.
Since $\frac{M}{R_*}$ is closely related to the energy production per unit mass, it is clear that denser objects yield better efficiency.
Also , in most cases the time scale of energy generation due too nuclear fusion is usually much longer then accretion time scale.
