# Chapter 1: Accretion as a source of energy.

## Flowing summery
Accretion of mass is thought to be one of the main power sources for different astrophysical phenomena.
Some order of magnitude calculations can show the production of energy in accretion:
The energy released by a body with mass $M$ and radius $R_*$ accretion $m$ mass is $\Delta E =\frac{GMm}{R_*}$ . For a neutron star with $M_\odot$  the radius of it is approximately $10km$ so the energy released per accreted mass can be $10^{20} \frac{erg}{g}$ , mainly as electromagnetic radiation. From fusion reaction  lets say H to He $10^{19} \frac{erg}{g}$.
Since $\frac{M}{R_*}$ is closely related to the energy production per unit mass, it is clear that denser objects yield better efficiency.
Also , in most cases the time scale of energy generation due too nuclear fusion is usually much longer then accretion time scale.
- The Eddington limit: The luminosity in which particles will be unbound by gravity due to the radiation pressure.
For Thompson scattering dominated and mainly ionized hydrogen gas $L_{edd} \approx 1.3 \times 10^{38}(\frac{M}{M_{\odot}})\frac{erg}{sec}$ .  
In the context of accretion this is like saying radiation pressure is so strong the accretion stops.
We can relate the accretion rate to the luminosity assuming a system that radiates only du to accretion.
$L=\frac{GM\dot{M}}{R_*}$  and so this shows that the Eddington limit can be expressed on the accretion rate as well.
