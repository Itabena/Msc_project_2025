# Chapter 1: Accretion as a source of energy.

## Flowing summery
Accretion of mass is thought to be one of the main power sources for different astrophysical phenomena.
Some order of magnitude calculations can show the production of energy in accretion:
The energy released by a body with mass $M$ and radius $R_*$ accretion $m$ mass is $\Delta E =\frac{GMm}{R_*}$ . For a neutron star with $M_\odot$  the radius of it is approximately $10km$ so the energy relesd per accreted mass can be $10^{20} \frac{erg}{g}$ , mainly as electromagnetic radiation.
