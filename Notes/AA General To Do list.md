- [ ]  Stellar tidal disruption events in general relativity (Read all).*This is a very long, very hands on paper, reading all of it seems in efficient, I read most f the introductory parts.*
- [ ] Read about accretion discs, specifically around black holes(chpaters 5,6,7 are most relevant).*I actually have red these chapters so maybe later for remembrance*
- [ ] GO back to GR and read lecture notes,(specifically on Schwazschild space time). 
- [ ] Learn some facts on these effects, what type of emission? what are the main mechanisms in each example? How many where observed? rate or estimate of frequency of detection.
- [ ] Before the test look at Wegg, and PW motivations.
