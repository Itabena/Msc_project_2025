## Tasks and Goals
- [ ] 

## Findings and Notes
- I am note sure about completely summarizing the papers, it is a lot of work that is not mandatory for this case.
- From PW I understand that it was crucial to them to get the ISCO and MBCO radius correctly, because, they wanted to model a thick part in the accretion disk which in some works , as explained to exit between the two radii. they get an incorrect energy conservation efficiency, probably because they create the wrong  orbital energy at the ISCO.

## Actions Taken
1. 

## Future Plans
