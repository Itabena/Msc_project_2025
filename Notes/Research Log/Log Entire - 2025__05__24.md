## Tasks and Goals
- [ ] 

## Findings and Notes
- I am note sure about completely summarizing the papers, it is a lot of work that is not mandatory for this case.
- From PW I understand that it was crucial to them to get the ISCO and MBCO radius correctly, because, they wanted to model a thick part in the accretion disk which in some works , as explained to exit between the two radii. they get an incorrect energy conservation efficiency, probably because they create the wrong  orbital energy at the ISCO.
- It is also seem that for there model the Angular momentum value is important.
- In Nowak & Wagoner, They replicate the frequency at circular orbits close to the USCO and the radial epicyclic frequency, which is the frequency of a mass unit , radially perturbated from a circular orbit. They need this because they research oscillations inside these accretion disks.
- 
- *Note: I think in general reading an article and summarizing it could be a good method , but for now , it is more efficient to take the important parts because of the lack of time.*
