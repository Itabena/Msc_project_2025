# Log Entire - 2025__05__24  
_Last modified: 2025-05-24_

## Tasks and Goals
- [ ] Change plots , use better colors (Not yellow).
- [ ] Finish optional plot of effeective potential and tragectory gifs around it.
- [ ] Add "bad" potential plot.
- [ ] Look at correct angular moentum or orbital energy ISCO alternatives.
- [ ] sdada


## Questions for reem :
- English or Hebrew?
- Is adding the small information about what feature is important to what phenomena enough?
- Understanding the Tejeda and Roswog better.
- Explain about PNPs that fit lets say only ISCO conditions.
- Is the explenation about TDE enough?
- Should we show all conditions?
- Should we show a bad result?
## Findings and Notes
- I am note sure about completely summarizing the papers, it is a lot of work that is not mandatory for this case.
- From PW I understand that it was crucial to them to get the ISCO and MBCO radius correctly, because, they wanted to model a thick part in the accretion disk which in some works , as explained to exist between the two radii. they get an incorrect energy conservation efficiency, probably because they create the wrong  orbital energy at the ISCO.
- It is also seem that for there model the Angular momentum value is important.
- In Nowak & Wagoner, They replicate the frequency at circular orbits close to the USCO and the radial epicyclic frequency, which is the frequency of a mass unit , radially perturbated from a circular orbit. They need this because they research oscillations inside these accretion disks.
- In Weggs paper, They tried to match the precession because they wanted to simulate galactic dynamics around supermassive black holes. so this is one use of these quantities.
- Tageda and roswogg, generate the equations of motion correctly but they are not the orbital specific energy, that couses some of their predictions to be slightly off.`this is not true`
- I think that saying that for tidal disruption events it is important to look at  the precession is ok.
- As I understand that from Nick And Elads papper, The PNP used there is because for PNPs where $R_p \propto R_g$  the precession plays a cruical role in the circulation of the matter of the star into an accretion disk. 
- *Note: I think in general reading an article and summarizing it could be a good method , but for now , it is more efficient to take the important parts because of the lack of time.*

## Actions Taken
1. Surveyed PW, Wagoner and Nowak, Wegg , Tejeda and Roswogg papper, also NIck and elads papper.
2. Read the appropriate chapters on accretion disck in the relevant book ([[Log Entire - 2025__05__23]] ).
3. Changed some small slides in the presentation.
## Future Plans
