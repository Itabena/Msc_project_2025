_Last modified: 2025-05-25_

## Tasks and Goals
- [ ] 

## Findings and Notes
-  For the 2 examples in the article (n1=1 and n1=7):
L/sqrt(12) for run 0 is 1.1008919179049041
E/(-1/9) for run 0 is 0.6548231260713167
L/sqrt(12) for run 1 is 1.0717282016860146
E/(-1/9) for run 1 is 0.9926962610428283

- With adding the additional orbital energy condition:
L/sqrt(12) for run 0 is 1.0685743503990917
E/(-1/9) for run 0 is 0.9999999999997082
L/sqrt(12) for run 1 is 1.0706674190424805
E/(-1/9) for run 1 is 1.00000000195405

- With only the angular momentum condition added:
L/sqrt(12) for run 0 is 1.000000000000494
E/(-1/9) for run 0 is 1.703565505803566
L/sqrt(12) for run 1 is 1.000000000142876
E/(-1/9) for run 1 is 1.9090711826192432

- With both ISCO conditions:
![[Example_for_bad_potential.png]]
L/sqrt(12) for run 0 is 1.0000000004007177
E/(-1/9) for run 0 is 0.9999999995915232
L/sqrt(12) for run 1 is 0.9999991841319881
E/(-1/9) for run 1 is 0.9999950542696752
