# Log Entire - 2025__05__29  
_Last modified: 2025-05-29_

## Tasks and Goals 
- [ ] Do first day plan of learning program for thesis test

## Findings and Notes
**Guiding Questions:**

- Why is accretion onto compact objects such a powerful energy source compared to nuclear fusion (e.g. how many erg per gram are released)?(Accretion book)
    
- What types of astrophysical systems are powered by accretion onto compact objects (name examples in binaries and galactic nuclei)(Accretion book)
    
- What is a tidal disruption event (TDE) in basic terms, and what conditions (stellar orbit and tidal radius) lead to a star being disrupted by a black hole[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.10180#:~:text=,8)?
    
- Above what black hole mass scale do stellar tidal disruptions require full general relativity to describe, and why is relativistic gravity important in those cases[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.10180#:~:text=bright%20electromagnetic%20flare%20as%20it,of%20relativistic%20precession%20on%20stream)? (Think about how close to the Schwarzschild radius the disruption happens for very massive SMBHs.)
