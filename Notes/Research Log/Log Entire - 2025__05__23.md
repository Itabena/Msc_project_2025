# Log Entire - 2025__05__23  
_Last modified: 2025-05-23_

## Tasks and Goals
- [ ] Summarizing the PW paper
- [ ] Summarizing the Wegg paper
- [ ] Summarizing the Tejeda & Roswog paper 

## Findings and Notes
- I didnt make the templates in obsidian the best, I still need to find how to make them better.
- After first glance on the PW1980 paper I understand I need to go back and read about the Sakura Sunyev model for accretion disks.
- After summarizing lets pin poin the questions: what is important to accertion disks models?

### Accretion Discs around black holes-

- First of all for an accretion disc around a star there is the Sakure-Sunyev model, which has some precription to the dynamical viscosity that leads to angular momentum loss. THe model consists of several differential equations setting conservation laws, hydrostatic equlibrium and so on, and is modeling an accretion disc that is reaching the surface of the star. Some of thos equations are dependant on said inner most boundry or the star radius.
-  With a black hole however, this model breaks where the angular velocity is no longer Keplerian and also close to the ISCO . Ususaly it is modeled as Newtonian with corrections and the ISCO is assumed as an inner edge though the accretion due to the GUI is smaller in comparison to the total accretion.
