## Tasks and Goals
- [ ] 

## Findings and Notes
- The maximum error in radial velocity r[5,6]:
max_diff_pw 115.16561235653941 %
max_diff_wegg 65.97239992525974 %
max_diff_pn_0 48.05303083004025 %
max_diff_pn_1 57.172737379191304 %
it is at r=5.

If we take the paper potentials and plot the differance from the GR precession.

- So we can see that for the two pnps presented in the  in the $L\rightarrow 4^+$ limit gets for $N_1=1$ less then $\frac{\pi}{4}$ deviation and $N_1=7$ gets somthing like $\frac{3\pi}{4}$ deviation, wegg gets somthin
