## Tasks and Goals
- [ ] 

## Findings and Notes
- The maximum error in radial velocity r[5,6]:
max_diff_pw 115.16561235653941 %
max_diff_wegg 65.97239992525974 %
max_diff_pn_0 48.05303083004025 %
max_diff_pn_1 57.172737379191304 %
it is at r=5.

If we take the paper potentials and plot the differance from the GR precession.

- So we can see that for the two pnps presented in the  in the $L\rightarrow 4^+$ limit gets for $N_1=1$ , $\approx 0.16\pi$  deviation and $N_1=7$ gets something like $\approx 0.7\pi$  deviation, Wegg gets something like $\approx 0.01\pi$ deviation and PW gets worse values that get even more then $2\pi$ .
So if we look on the bad place:

We can see the N1=1 can get 0 and negative precession (more then 100% error) for the intermediate values and N1=7 gets to about maximum of 50 to 60 precents.
the region it is bad at is between L=4.3/.2 to L=20 for N1=1 or L=8 for N1 =7![[The bad precession zone.png]]
