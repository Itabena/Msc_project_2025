## Tasks and Goals
- [ ] 

## Questions for reem :
- English or Hebrew?
- Is adding the small information about what feature is important to what phenomena enough?*What I know is enough, learn a little bit more about TDE and Accretion discs in the broad sence* 
- Understanding the Tejeda and Roswog better.*I need to calculate agian but it seems that the main differance is the $\epsilon$  energy part*
- Explain about PNPs that fit lets say only ISCO conditions.
- Is the explenation about TDE enough?
- Should we show all conditions?*yes*
- Should we show a bad result?*yes*
- Should the point be the specific result or the general method?*yes*
- How deep should i go in understanding Accretion discs and TDEs?*Not too much* 
- Should we do some kind of parameter scan, change rs and N1 on the same conditions to see the effectiveness?*no need*
- *In general it seems that reem thinks the presentation is good, and the explplenations are good, try and learn more about TDEs and GR recall rules and calculations. also change the slide with all of the conditions to have words and equations, add to the table also the conditions as before and change the % error in precession to error in radians, not the PW has $\infty$ error.*
