write a funny poem about birds 30 words

<response>
In the trees, some feathery jesters reside,  
Chirping sonnets and squawking with pride.  
Wearing hats, they’re quite avant-garde—  
Dabbling in art from branch to card.  

One tried juggling berries mid-flight,  
Another danced on his own left foot tight.  
The pigeon proclaimed he'd be a king,  
While the sparrow sang opera—oh my!  

What a sight it is under the sky so grand!  
A feathered comedy troupe takes a stand.
