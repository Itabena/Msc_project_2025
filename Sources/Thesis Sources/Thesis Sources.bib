These have \DH ner resolution in the inner disk than any previously reported. Finer resolution leads to increased magnetic \DH eld strength, greater accretion rate, and greater \~Nuctuations in the accretion rate. One simulation begins with a purely poloidal magnetic \DH eld, the other with a purely toroidal \DH eld. Compared to the poloidal initial \DH eld simulation, a purely toroidal initial \DH eld takes longer to reach saturation of the magnetorotational instability and produces less turbulence and weaker magnetic \DH eld energies. For both initial \DH eld con\DH gurations, magnetic stresses continue across the marginally stable orbit ; measured in units corresponding to the ShakuraSunyaev a-parameter, the stress grows from D0.1 in the disk body to as much as D10 deep in the plunging region. Matter passing the inner boundary of the simulation has D10\% greater binding energy and D10\% smaller angular momentum than it did at the marginally stable orbit. Both the mass accretion rate and the integrated stress \~Nuctuate widely on a broad range of timescales.},

The dominant relativistic effects, which allow modes to be trapped within the inner region of the disk, are approximated via a modified Newtonian potential. A general formalism is developed for investigating the adiabatic oscillations of arbitary unperturbed disk models. We explore the generic behavior via an expansion of the Lagrangian displacement about the plane of sysmmetry and by assuming separable solutions with the same radial wavelength for the horizontal and vertical perturbations. We obtain the lowest eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of a particular set of radial and quadrupole modes which have minimum motion normal to the plane. These modes correspond to the standard dispersion relation of disk theory. In future papers we will study a wide variety of modes and compute the rates of growth or damping of these modes due to gravitational radiation and various models of viscosity.},

Shapes and potential depths are determined for the marginally stable barotropic tori with uniform distribution of specific angular momentum, using both the pseudo-Newtonian and fully relativistic approach. For the adiabatic (isoentropic) perfect fluid, temperature profiles, mass-density and pressure profiles and total masses of pseudo-Newtonian and relativistic tori are compared providing important information on the relevance of the test-disc approximation in both the approaches. It is shown that the pseudo-Newtonian approach can be precise enough and useful for the modelling of accretion discs in the Schwarzschild--de Sitter spacetimes with the cosmological parameter y = M2/3 10-6. For astrophysically relevant black holes with y {$<$} 10-25, this statement is tested and shown to be precise in few per cent for both accretion and excretion tori and for the marginally bound, i.e. maximally extended, tori allowing simultaneous inflow to the black hole and outflow to the outer space.},

  abstract = {A generalized Newtonian potential is derived from the geodesic motion of test particles in Schwarzschild spacetime. This potential reproduces several relativistic features with higher accuracy than commonly used pseudo-Newtonian approaches. The new potential reproduces the exact location of the marginally stable, marginally bound, and photon circular orbits, as well as the exact radial dependence of the binding energy and the angular momentum of these orbits. Moreover, it reproduces the orbital and epicyclic angular frequencies to better than 6\%. In addition, the spatial projections of general trajectories coincide with their relativistic counterparts, while the time evolution of parabolic-like trajectories and the pericentre advance of elliptical-like trajectories are both reproduced exactly. We apply this approach to a standard thin accretion disc and find that the efficiency of energy extraction agrees to within 3\% with the exact relativistic value, while the energy flux per unit area as a function of radius is reproduced everywhere to better than 7\%. As a further astrophysical application we implement the new approach within a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code and study the tidal disruption of a main sequence star by a supermassive black hole. The results obtained are in very good agreement with previous relativistic simulations of tidal disruptions in Schwarzschild spacetime. The equations of motion derived from this potential can be implemented easily within existing Newtonian hydrodynamics codes with hardly any additional computational effort.},

  abstract = {We describe a pseudo-Newtonian potential which, to within 1\% error at all angular momenta, reproduces the precession due to general relativity of particles whose specific orbital energy is small compared to c2 in the Schwarzschild metric. For bound orbits, the constraint of low energy is equivalent to requiring the apoapsis of a particle to be large compared to the Schwarzschild radius. Such low-energy orbits are ubiquitous close to supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei, but the potential is relevant in any context containing particles on low-energy orbits. Like the more complex post-Newtonian expressions, the potential correctly reproduces the precession in the far field, but also correctly reproduces the position and magnitude of the logarithmic divergence in precession for low angular momentum orbits. An additional advantage lies in its simplicity, both in computation and implementation. We also provide two simpler, but less accurate potentials, for cases where orbits always remain at large angular momenta, or when the extra accuracy is not needed. In all of the presented cases, the accuracy in precession in low-energy orbits exceeds that of the well-known potential of Paczy\textasciiacute nski \& Wiita, which has {$\sim$}30\% error in the precession at all angular momenta.},
